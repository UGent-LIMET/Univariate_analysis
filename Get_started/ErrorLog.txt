##########Frequently got errors##########
#### MAIN ####
Error in setwd(path_R_scripts) : cannot change working directory
= forget to change path of computer, or typing error in folder "R_scripts" (eg. Rscripts)

Error in setwd(path_data_in) : cannot change working directory
= path is correct, problem: projectname wrong (eg written with space), non-existent folder to input (development after source config w wrong name)

Error : cannot allocate vector of size 7.8 Mb
or 
killed during process 
= not enough RAM for R pipeline to compute (probably step annotate from part pre-processing Thermo), increase RAM of Rbox if possible

Not engough space
= hard drive is full, free up space for calculating

Error in file(file, ifelse(append, "a", "w")) : cannot open the connection
= close excel, close other files opened, check path in main.r correct 

Error in file(filename, "r", encoding = encoding): cannot open the connection
Calls: source -> file
In addition: Warning message: In file (filename, "r", encoding = encoding): cannot open file 'configuration.R': No such file or directory
Execution halted
= configuration.r.r extension is wrong, check configuration.r instead of twice suffix .r

(process:5453): Pango-WARNING **: Invalid UTF-8 string passed to pango_layout_set_text()
= created/exported txt can be in wrong format (incorrect UTF-8), copy/paste from txt to txt to solve.


####PART 2: univariate analysis####
Error in made.names(col.names, unique = TRUE):
   invalid mulitbyte string at '<ff><fe>S'
=> make sure no symboles in the MetaboliteName in VM, no symbols ("'", ",", """, "alfa", "beta", ENTERS)

Error in `[.data.frame`(data, , x) : undefined columns selected
=> in variablemetadata/samplemetadata below table random cell with content

stopifnot(min(variableMetadata[,COLLUMN_NR_START_SAMPLES:ncol(variableMetadata)]) >= 0) #no negative numbers allowed
=> in VM loading error because negative values or NAs (empty cells) present in VM intensities

Error in `rownames<-`(`*tmp*`, value = c(17L, 26L, 15L, 9L, 29L, 8L, 1L,  : 
  attempt to set 'rownames' on an object with no dimensions
=> Min 2 standards needed for script to work

Error in `rownames<-`(`*tmp*`, value = samples_metadata_comp$Name) : 
  attempt to set 'rownames' on an object with no dimensions
=> Min 2 standards needed for script to work, if 2 standards are present, check if all zero-values of variable in the comparison. easy fix: duplicate standards in VM to work. 

Error in `row.names<-.data.frame`(`*tmp*`, value = value) : 
  duplicate 'row.names' are not allowed
In addition: Warning message:
non-unique value when setting 'row.names': ‘iQC’
=> in SM column Name: use unique names (not eg iQC but iQC1)

Error in readRDS(ffile) : error reading from connection
Calls: source -> withVisible -> eval -> eval -> library -> readRDS
Execution halted
=> in rbox dunn.test installed but not saved (ask Marilyn)
