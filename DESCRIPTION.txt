# Description: This module performs hierarchical clustering of the biological samples, shows variables intensities in heat maps according to clustering samples and according to group labels; and creates boxplots of variables (univariate analysis). 
# Input: 
# -	Configuration.R
# -	VariableMetadata.txt
# -	SampleMetadata.txt
# Output: 
# -	Heat map of samples hierarchical clustered according to samples and corresponding dendrogram
# -	Per pairwise comparison:
#   o	Heat map of samples according to group labels
#   o	Box plots of significant (p<0.05; “SIGNIF”) and not significant (“SN”) variables using unpaired Student’s or Welch’s t-test (with or without an unequal variance) if normal distribution is obtained (Shapiro-Wilk Test)
#   o	Box plots of significant (p<0.05; “SIGNIF”) and not significant (“SN”) variables using Mann-Whitney U test if no normal distribution is obtained (Shapiro-Wilk Test)
#   o	Table containing p-values, number of samples, mean and SD per group
# -	Per multiple comparison:
#   o	Heat map of samples according to group labels
#   o	Box plots of significant (p<0.05; “SIGNIF”) and not significant (“SN”) variables using one-way ANOVA if normal distribution is obtained (Shapiro-Wilk Test)
#   o	Box plots of significant (p<0.05; “SIGNIF”) and not significant (“SN”) variables using Kruskal Wallis if no normal distribution is obtained (Shapiro-Wilk Test)
#   o	Table containing p-values, number of samples, mean and SD per group
#   o	For significant metabolites after one-way ANOVA, Tukeys Honest Significant Difference post-hoc test: table with in-between comparisons adjusted p-values and mean difference plot
#   o	For significant metabolites after Kruskal Wallis, Dunn’s post-hoc test: table with in-between comparisons adjusted p-values using Benjamini-Hochberg correction
